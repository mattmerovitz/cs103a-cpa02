My app is an inventory tracker which would be very useful for a small business.

If you click on "Add to your inventory list", you have the ability to add an item to the Inventory list. This is done by adding a variety of information about the item.

From here, clicking on "View current inventory list" will show all of the current items on the inventory list on an easy-to-view table.

When an item on the inventory list is sold, the user can input "Selling price" into the form and press "Mark Sold" to move the item to the sold list. This will also redirect directly to the sold list, where the sold items are shown in another easy-to-view table. This will also calculate revenue and profit of the sold items.

In addition to the main functionality, there is a sneaker finding API, which gives the ability to conveniently search for any sneaker based on keywords.
